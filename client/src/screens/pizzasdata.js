    "description": "Grandma pie is an American pizza variety that differentiates itself by the crust – due to the fact that the dough isn't allowed to proof for a long time, it turns out thin and dense. The pizza is baked in metal pans, resulting in rectangular slices that are crispy on the bottom. It is typically topped with shredded mozzarella, tomato sauce, garlic, and olive oil, although there are numerous variations with added ingredients such as sausages and broccoli rabe. Grandma pie originated on Long Island at a family-run restaurant called Umberto's."

It is characterized by its thick, wettish dough, greasy cheese, and tomato sauce with a strong taste of oregano. This type of pizza is usually baked in a heavily greased pan, which results in a lacy, crisp edge and fried bottom crust."

    "description": "This variety of pizza is made by placing the stretched dough on the grates over hot coals, cooking it one side, flipping the dough, and topping it in reverse – cheese first, sauce second. It is then returned on the grates in order for the other side to cook and for the cheese to melt."
